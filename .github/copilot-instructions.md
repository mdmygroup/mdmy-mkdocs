You are tasked to create a complete, ready-to-use MkDocs documentation repository that uses the Material for MkDocs theme.
This repository will host technical or business documentation coming from multiple Markdown files organized across folders.
The project must follow the best practices of documentation sites, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and ease of contribution â€” even for non-technical users.
