# MDMY Tech Stack Documentation

Welcome to the **MDMY Tech Stack** documentation hub. This section outlines the technologies, tools, and architectural decisions that shape our engineering foundation. It serves as both a reference and a rationale for how we build, scale, and maintain our systems.

## 📌 Purpose

The goal of this section is to document the **core components** of our technical ecosystem and to provide transparent reasoning behind each major decision. This will be the central place where we track:

- Chosen languages, frameworks, and platforms
- Infrastructure and deployment strategies
- Design patterns and architectural principles
- Tools and services we use in development, testing, and operations
- Future recommendations and evaluation criteria

## 🧠 Thought Process Behind Our Stack

At MDMY, our tech stack is not a static list of tools — it's a reflection of our values and priorities:

- **Scalability**: We choose technologies that can grow with us, supporting higher loads without major refactoring.
- **Developer Experience**: Tools should help engineers move fast without sacrificing quality or maintainability.
- **Interoperability**: We prioritize tools that play well with others and integrate easily into our ecosystem.
- **Security by Design**: Every decision considers best practices in security, compliance, and data privacy.
- **Community and Longevity**: We favor technologies with strong community support, ongoing development, and long-term viability.

## 📂 What You’ll Find Here

As this documentation grows, you’ll find detailed pages on:

- ✅ Language & Framework Choices (e.g., TypeScript, Python, React)
- ☁️ Infrastructure Stack (e.g., AWS, Vercel, Terraform)
- 🛠 Development Tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, Linting/Formatting, Testing Frameworks)
- 🧱 Architecture Guidelines (e.g., monorepo structure, service boundaries)
- 🔄 CI/CD & DevOps Practices
- 🔒 Security & Compliance Considerations
- 📈 Monitoring & Observability Tools
- 🚀 Future Recommendations & Evaluation Criteria

Each section will include:
- **What we use**
- **Why we chose it**
- **When to use or avoid it**
- **How to get started**

## 🚧 Ongoing Evolution

Technology evolves, and so do we. This documentation is meant to be living — updated as we experiment, learn, and iterate. Future recommendations will be clearly marked and justified based on current limitations, new opportunities, or changing business needs.
